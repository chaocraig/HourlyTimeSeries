The Q3 of The Data Incubator Challenge 2014/07

Hourly weather data from 5 cities is provided for the period 2000 Â­ 2011. The fields are year, month, day, hour (local time), temperature (in tenths of a degree celsius), pressure (in tenths of a hectopascals), wind direction (clockwise angular degrees from north), and wind speed (tenths of a meter per second). The gzipped (http://www.gzip.org/) files are A (static/challenge/A_train.txt.gz), B (static/challenge/B_train.txt.gz), C (static/challenge/C_train.txt.gz), D (static/challenge/D_train.txt.gz), E (static/challenge/E_train.txt.gz). A sample of the data is provided below:
